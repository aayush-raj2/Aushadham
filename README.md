# Aushadham - Medical Healthcare Platform(Smarter, Faster, Healthier)

## Available Backends

This project includes **two backend implementations**:

1. **Python Flask Backend** - Original implementation (`app.py`)
   - Run: `python app.py`
   - Requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Java Spring Boot Backend** - New implementation (`aushadham-backend/`)
   - Build: `cd aushadham-backend && mvn clean package`
   - Run: `java -jar target/aushadham-backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Both backends provide identical API functionality and work with the same frontend (`index.html`).

**Aushadham: Bridging India‚Äôs Rural Healthcare Gap with AI and Voice-Driven Triage**  

Aushadham is a revolutionary healthcare platform designed to democratize access to quality medical care in India, with a laser focus on underserved rural populations. By integrating AI-powered symptom assessment, voice-based triage, and smart care coordination, the platform addresses systemic challenges such as acute doctor shortages, delayed diagnoses, and the near-absence of specialist care in remote regions. HealthAssist empowers patients to become the first point of contact in their healthcare journey, reducing unnecessary clinic visits, optimizing clinical efficiency, and ensuring critical cases receive urgent attention‚Äîall while lowering costs for patients and providers alike.  

### **Core Innovations**  
1. **AI-Driven First Appointment**:  
   - Patients input symptoms via a mobile app **or voice call**, triggering an adaptive questionnaire that mimics clinical reasoning. The AI model, trained on Indian health datasets, prioritizes region-specific conditions (e.g., tuberculosis, anemia) and generates a prioritized list of potential diagnoses with criticality scores.  
   - **Impact**: Reduces strain on overburdened doctors by resolving 30-40% of non-urgent cases at the triage stage.  

2. **Voice-Based Accessibility for Rural India**:  
   - **Toll-Free IVR System**: Patients without smartphones can call, authenticate via ABHA ID + OTP, and navigate the questionnaire using voice or keypad inputs. Speech-to-text engines tailored for Indian accents and regional languages ensure inclusivity.  
   - **Offline Coordination**: Post-assessment, lab referrals and appointment details are shared via SMS (with QR codes), bypassing internet dependency.  

3. **Specialist Shortage Mitigation**:  
   - The platform‚Äôs **Connection Algorithm** directs patients to the nearest available general physician or specialist, prioritizing severity and geographic proximity. Telemedicine integrations enable remote consultations for rare conditions.  
   - **Cost Efficiency**: Slashes travel expenses for rural patients and reduces ‚Äúdoctor-hopping‚Äù by 50% through accurate initial assessments.  

4. **Scalable Public Health Integration**:  
   - Partners with government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat and NIKSHAY (TB eradication) to identify disease outbreaks early. Aggregated anonymized data helps policymakers allocate resources to high-risk areas.  

### **Solving India‚Äôs Healthcare Challenges**  
- **Preventive Care**: Flags high-risk patients (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) for early intervention, reducing long-term costs.  
- **Reducing Misdiagnosis**: Standardized AI protocols minimize human error in rushed rural clinics.  
- **Empowering ASHA Workers**: Equips frontline workers with the platform to screen communities during outreach, with real-time doctor backup.  
- **ABHA Compliance**: Ensures seamless interoperability with India‚Äôs digital health ecosystem while adhering to DPDP Act (2023) standards.  

### **üßÆ Real-World Context**

ü©π Problem:
75% of India‚Äôs healthcare infrastructure lies in urban zones, while only ~36.9% of people live there.

üí° Solution:
Aushadham enables first-visit triage and telemedicine access through an offline-capable, AI-powered Android app.


### **Vision**  
HealthAssist is not merely an app‚Äîit is a lifeline for millions trapped in healthcare deserts. By combining cutting-edge technology with grassroots accessibility, the platform bridges urban-rural disparities, transforms preventive care, and amplifies the impact of India‚Äôs limited medical workforce. For rural patients, it means timely, affordable, and dignified care. For doctors, it means focusing expertise where it matters most. For India, it means a healthier, more equitable future.
